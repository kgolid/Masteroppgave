\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:Concluding remarks}
In the process of repeatedly generalizing our graph structural definitions, we have reached a situation where our current definition is almost identical to the actual axioms and rule-applications in our proof system; more specifically, the applications with binary NAND-clauses in their conclusion.
This comes as no surprise, but is a bit disappointing.
The original goal was to find some graph structual relation $V$, independent of the definition of Neg, such that $V(a,b) \; \Leftrightarrow \; \vdash \ol{ab}$ (implication (1) and (2)).
This would as a result give us a graph structure present only when the graph in question was kernel free.
It has however become apparent that no simple graph structural definition suffices in satisfying these implications.
Even $V_3$ falls short in this endeavour.
