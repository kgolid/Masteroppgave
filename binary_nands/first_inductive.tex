\section{Generalizing trimming}
\label{sec:Generalizing trimming}
In this section, we will take a closer look at the current concept of trimming, and through some examples introduce a more general definition.
So far, trimming has meant forcing certain vertices to point only at its successor in a path.

In Section~\ref{sec:Odd paths} we motivated the concept of trimmed paths by presenting the Figure~\ref{fig:kernel_untrimmed}.
The figure shows how a path that normally provides a provable NAND-clause may be ``ruined'' by adding out-edges to certain vertices in the path, making certain vital OR-clauses non-binary and thus making the NAND-clause unprovable.

Notice however that adding a loop on the vertex to which the path branches, leaves us with a completely different situation.\par
\begin{figure}[!h]

    \draw [-latex, loop right] (2b) to (2b);

    \node (e4) [above right=4mm and 6mm of 4] {};
    \node (e5) [right=8mm of 4] {};
    \node (e6) [below right=4mm and 6mm of 4] {};

    \draw [dashed] (e6) to (4);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:path_3_with_loop}
\end{figure}
The addition of the loop adds $\ol{z}$ to the axioms.
The NAND-clause $\ol{ab}$ can now easily be proven in the following way:\par
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{prooftree*}
    \Hypo{\ol{ax}}
    \Hypo{\ol{yb}}
    \Hypo{\ol{z}}
    \Infer[left label=$xyz$]3{\ol{ab}}
  \end{prooftree*}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:proof_loop}
\end{figure}
This shows the fact that vertices at odd positions in a path can indeed branch off to other vertices than their path successor and still contribute to a provable NAND-clause, just as long as the vertices they branch off to are provably false in Neg.
If the vertex is provably false, we can use that unary NAND-clause, like we did in the above proof, to handle the non-binary OR-clauses.
This observation lets us generalize our notion of trimmed vertices.

The big problem with this generalization is that it makes our vel-relation no longer a purely graph-structural one.
With such a definition, whenever we want to check whether two vertices have a vel between them, we may have to work out the actual provability of certain unary NAND-clauses.
This is exactly what we try to avoid with our vel-relation.

To make matters worse, consider the following two graphs:\par
\begin{figure}[h!]

    [
    point/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm},

    \draw [dashed] (e6) to (4);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:path_3_with_backedges}
\end{figure}
Like with the graph from Figure~\ref{fig:path_3_with_loop}, the above graphs are both based on Figure~\ref{fig:kernel_untrimmed}, each with only one edge added.
The left variant has $\ol{az}$ in its axioms, while the right variant has $\ol{bz}$, again making their respective proofs of $\ol{ab}$ almost trivial.\par

The above proofs do not rely on any provably false vertex, but rather make use of the fact that $z$ is connected to one of the vertices contained in the NAND-clause that we are trying to prove.

In the case of Figure~\ref{fig:path_3_with_backedges}, $\ol{ab}$ will be provable as long as for all the successors $z$ of $x$, either $\ol{z}$, $\ol{az}$ or $\ol{bz}$ are provable in Neg.

This means that our concept of trimming needs further weakening, taking into account the observation made above.
Such a weakening will simply add the case where, given a vel between $a$ and $b$, trimmed vertices may branch off to vertices $c$ as long as either $\ol{ac}$ or $\ol{bc}$ are provable in Neg.

The definition now bases the provability of $\ol{ab}$ on the provability of a set of other binary NAND-clauses, suggesting an inductive approach for our definitions.

\section{Inductive definitions}
\label{sec:Inductive definitions}
All the graph structures presented in this chapter so far can easily be defined inductively.
For instance, given some graph $\mathbf{G}=(G,N)$, let $V_1 \subseteq G \times G$ denote the set of all pairs of vertices related by our original vel-definition (Definition~\ref{def:vel}) where `trimmed' meant strictly non-branching.

We can define $V_1$ inductively in the following way, with $a$ and $b$ being arbitrary vertices from $G$.
\begin{align}
  \textbf{(BC):}&\quad N(a,b) \vee N(b,a) &\Rightarrow  V_1(a,b)\\
  \textbf{(IS):}&\quad \exists c \in N(a): (N(c) =\{d\} \wedge V_1(d,b)) &\Rightarrow V_1(a,b)
\end{align}
The symmetry in the base case is what makes this a definition of a vel and not a path, while the trimmed-ness gets expressed by the restrictions we set on vertex $c$.

Adding the new weaker trimming-restriction is now easy.
Let $V_2 \subseteq G \times G$ be the set of all pairs of vertices related by our new vel-definition.
$V_2$ can be defined inductively in the following way, again with $a$ and $b$ as arbitrary vertices from $G$.
\begin{align}
  \textbf{(BC):}&\quad N(a,b) \vee N(b,a) &\Rightarrow V_2(a,b)\label{eq:V2_BC}\\
  \textbf{(IS):}&\quad \exists c \in N(a):
  \left ( \begin{tabular}{l}
  $\exists d \in N(c): V_2(d,b) \quad \wedge$\\
  $\forall d \in N(c): V_2(d,b) \vee V_2(d,a) \vee V_2(d,d)$
  \end{tabular} \right )
  &\Rightarrow V_2(a,b)\label{eq:V2_IS}
\end{align}
Using the definition above, the fact that $V_2(a,b) \;\Rightarrow\; \vdash \ol{ab}$ can be proven inductively, showing that $V_2$ satisfies implication (1):
\begin{proof}
  Given a graph $G$ with two vertices $a$ and $b$ such that $V_2(a,b)$:

  Base case:
  If $N(a,b)$ or $N(b,a)$, then the NAND-clause $\ol{ab}$ will be an axiom and thus trivially provable.

  Inductive step:
  The existence of a vertex $c \in N(a)$ gives us that the NAND-clause $\ol{ac}$ is an axiom.
  Letting $D$ denoting the set $N(c)$ we also have that the OR-clause $cD$ is an axiom.
  This gives us the following incomplete proof:\par
  \begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{prooftree*}
      \Hypo{\ol{ac}}
      \Hypo{\dots}
      \Infer[right label=$cD$]2{\ol{ab}}
    \end{prooftree*}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:proof_v2_partial}
  \end{figure}
  Let $D_b$, $D_a$ and $D_d$ be subsets of $D$ such that for any $d \in D$:
  \begin{align}
    d \in D_b \Leftrightarrow V_2(d,b),\quad d \in D_a \Leftrightarrow V_2(d,a),\quad d \in D_d \Leftrightarrow V_2(d,d)
  \end{align}
  The inductive part of the $V_2$ definition (\ref{eq:V2_IS}) reveals two properties of the sets $D_b$, $D_a$ and $D_d$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The set $D_b$ is nonempty, since $\exists d \in N(c): V_2(d,b)$.
    \item $D_b \cup D_a \cup D_d = D$, since $\forall d \in N(c): V_2(d,b) \vee V_2(d,a) \vee V_2(d,d)$.
  \end{itemize}
  The induction hypothesis lets us assume the provability of the following sets of NAND-clauses:
  $\{ \ol{db} \;|\; d \in D_b \},\{ \ol{da} \;|\; d \in D_a \},\{ \ol{d} \;|\; d \in D_d \}$.
  Inserting these clauses into the incomplete proof from Figure~\ref{fig:proof_v2_partial} results the following proof:\par
  \begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{prooftree*}
      \Hypo{\ol{ac}}
      \Hypo{ \{ \ol{db} \;|\; d \in D_b \} }
      \Hypo{ \{ \ol{da} \;|\; d \in D_a \} }
      \Hypo{ \{ \ol{d} \;|\; d \in D_d \} }
      \Infer[right label=$cD$]4{\ol{ab}}
    \end{prooftree*}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:proof_v2}
  \end{figure}
The nonemptiness of $D_b$ gives us the existence of a $b$ in the premise, while he fact that $D_b \cup D_a \cup D_d = D$ guarantees that each atom in the OR-clause $D$ has a match in a NAND-clause.

The proof is thus valid, finishing the inductive step and ultimately proving the fact that $V_2(a,b) \Rightarrow \vdash \ol{ab}$.
\end{proof}
Having that $V_2$ satisfies implication (1), if one could show that it also satisfies implication (2), the consequences would be considerable.
It would mean that any provable binary NAND-clause would have a proof that in each step combined a set of already proved binary NAND-clauses with an axiom.
Any provable NAND-clause could in other words be constructed by adding one fresh axiom at every step, hinting at a possible normal form of proofs in Neg.

Unfortunately, $V_2$ does \textit{not} satisfy implication (2).
The vertices $a$ and $b$ in the graph presented below will not be related by $V_2$, but $\ol{ab}$ is still provable in Neg.
The graph will thus act as a counterexample for implication (2).\par

    \draw [-latex] (b) to (c2);

  \caption{}
  \label{fig:v2_counter_graph}
\end{figure}
Given the above graph, $\ol{ab}$ can be proven like follows:\par
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \begin{prooftree*}
    \Hypo{\ol{ax}}
    \Hypo{\ol{yz}}
    \Infer[left label=$xy$]2{\ol{az}}

    \Infer[right label=$zc_1c_2$]3{\ol{ab}}
  \end{prooftree*}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:v2_counter_proof}
\end{figure}
To show that the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:v2_counter_graph} is not an instance of $V_2$ demands a closer look at the graph.

Assume $V_2(a,b)$.
Since $a$ and $b$ are not connected by an edge, their relation has to be an instance of the inductive step.
Because of the following requirement: $\exists c \in N(a):\exists d \in N(c): V_2(d,b)$, either $a$  must have a successor $c$ which again has a successor $d$ such that $V_2(d,b)$ or $b$ must have a successor $c$ which again has a successor $d$ such that $V_2(d,a)$.

$a$ and $b$ has a total of 3 successors of which 2 are sinks and thereby unable to satisfy the requirement.
The last successor is the vertex $x$, which only has one successor, vertex $y$.\par
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    [
    point/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm},
    one/.style={fill=black}
    ]
    \node (a) at (0,4) [point, label=left:$a$] {};
    \node (x) at (1,3) [point, label=right:$x$] {};
    \node (y) at (1,2) [point,one, label=right:$y$] {};
    \node (z) at (1,1) [point, label=right:$z$] {};
    \node (c1) at (0,0) [point,one, label=left:$c_1$] {};
    \node (c2) at (2,0) [point, label=right:$c_2$] {};
    \node (b) at (2,4) [point,one, label=right:$b$] {};
    \draw [-latex] (a) to (c1);
    \draw [-latex] (a) to (x);
    \draw [-latex] (x) to (y);
    \draw [-latex] (y) to (z);
    \draw [-latex] (z) to (c1);
    \draw [-latex] (z) to (c2);
    \draw [-latex] (b) to (c2);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:v2_counter_assignment}
\end{figure}
The above solution shows us by soundness of Neg that $\ol{yb}$ is unprovable, and therefore by implication (1) that $y$ and $b$ cannot be $V_2$-related.
Since none of the successors of $a$ and $b$ satisfies the requirement, they also are not $V_2$ related.
We can therefore conclude that $V_2$ does not satisfy implication (2).
