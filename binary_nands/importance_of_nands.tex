\section{The importance of binary NAND-clauses}
\label{sec:The importance of binary NAND-clauses}
\subsection{Inconsistency and unary NAND-clauses}
\label{sub:Inconsistency and unary NAND-clauses}
Since our proof system, Neg, only has one rule, the last step of an inconsistency proof will always look the same:
\begin{prooftree*}
  \Hypo{\ol{x_1}}
  \Hypo{\ol{x_2}}
  \Hypo{\ol{x_3}}
  \Hypo{\dots}
  \Infer4[$x_1x_2x_3\dots$]{\varnothing}
\end{prooftree*}
The last step will always consist of a collection of NAND-clauses, each of length 1, together with an OR-clause equal to the union of all the NAND-clauses.
It is easy to see that none of the NAND-clauses can be binary, since that would result in a non-empty NAND-clause in the conclusion.
The OR-clause has to equal the union of the NAND-clauses simply by definition of the (RNeg)-rule.

This fact was also observed and formalized by Walicki in \cite{michal-completeness}:
\begin{align}
  \Gamma \vdash_{Neg} \{\} \Leftrightarrow \exists K \in \text{OR}: (\forall  k \in K: \Gamma \vdash_{Neg} \ol{k})
\end{align}
We know from the definition that any OR-clause used in the proof system corresponds to a single vertex with its successors in the graph.
We do however not know what the NAND-clauses of length 1 might correspond to.
Knowing this would, by soundness and completeness of Neg, give us a complete picture of the graph structure needed for a kernel not to exist.\todo{Currently brushing over the restrictions set to the proofs of completeness and soundness. Will fix this later.}

The only thing we \textit{do} know about unary NAND-clauses is that they correspond to vertices that is assigned 0 in all models of the graph.
We get this from soundness of Neg.
This is however not a graph structural property, which is what we are ultimately looking for.

So what does a unary NAND-clause proven in Neg correspond to in the graph?
Similarly to a proof of $\varnothing$, there is really just one way to prove a unary NAND-clause.
\begin{prooftree*}
  \Hypo{\ol{xy_1}}
  \Hypo{\ol{xy_2}}
  \Hypo{\dots}
  \Hypo{\ol{y_n}}
  \Hypo{\ol{y_{n+1}}}
  \Hypo{\dots}
  \Infer6[$y_1y_2\dots y_ny_{n+1}\dots$]{\ol{x}}
\end{prooftree*}
