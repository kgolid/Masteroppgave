In this chapter we will motivate the search for graph structural equivalents of unary and binary NAND-clauses proven in Neg.
An actual graph structure corresponding to the NAND-clauses will not be presented, but some necessary conditions will be shown for both directions.
In other words, we will search for graph structures implying certain provable NAND-clauses, as well as what certain provable NAND-clauses implies about the corresponding graph.
