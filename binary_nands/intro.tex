  A clause is \textit{unary} if it contains only one atom.
  A clause is \textit{binary} if it consists of one or two atoms.\todo{should both lengths be included?}
\end{definition}
In this chapter we will motivate and conduct the search for graph structural equivalents of binary NAND-clauses proven in Neg.
An actual graph structure corresponding to the NAND-clauses will not be presented, but we will show some graph structures implying the provability of certain binary NAND-clauses.
