  A clause is \textit{unary} if it contains only one atom.
  A clause is \textit{binary} if it consists of one or two atoms.

In this chapter, we will motivate and conduct the search for graph structural equivalents of binary NAND-clauses provable in Neg.
An actual graph structure corresponding to the binary NAND-clauses has not been found, but we will show various graph structures implying the provability of certain binary NAND-clauses.
