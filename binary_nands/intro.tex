In this chapter we will investigate the statement that whenever a theory is inconsistent, it can be proven in Neg using binary NAND-clauses only.
We will also explain why such a result would be of great use to us in an attempt to further characterize a kernel-free graph.
We will check the statement first for arbitrary theories, then for graph-theories.
