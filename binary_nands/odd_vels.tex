\section{Odd vels}
\label{sec:Odd vels}
The following observation will further generalize the concept of oddly trimmed paths:

The direction of edges in a graph can often be changed individually while still keeping many axiomatic clauses unchanged, including all the NAND-clauses.

Consider the following graph:\par
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    [
    point/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm}
    ]
    \node (x0) at (0,3) [point, label=above:$x_0$] {};
    \node (x1) at (1,2) [point, label=above:$x_1$] {};

    \node (x3) at (3,0) [point, label=above:$x_3$] {};

    \node (x5) at (5,2) [point, label=above:$x_5$] {};
    \draw [-latex] (x0) to (x1);
    \draw [-latex] (x1) to (x2);
    \draw [-latex] (x2) to (x3);
    \draw [-latex] (x4) to (x3);
    \draw [-latex] (x5) to (x4);

    \node (e1) [below left=6mm and 4mm of x3]  {};
    \node (e2) [below=8mm of x3] {};
    \node (e3) [below right=6mm and 4mm of x3] {};
    \draw [dashed] (e1) to (x3);
    \draw [dashed] (e2) to (x3);
    \draw [dashed] (e3) to (x3);

    \node (b0) [below left=6mm and 4mm of x0] {};
    \node (b2) [below left=6mm and 4mm of x2] {};
    \node (b5) [below right=6mm and 4mm of x5] {};

    \draw [dashed] (x2) to (b2);

From the above graph, $\ol{x_0x_5}$ can be proven in the same way as in the proof of $\ol{x_0x_9}$ from earlier.
Again, the only thing we are changing in terms of the axioms are the OR-clauses that are not used in the proof.

We will call this kind of graph structure an \textit{odd vel} and define it formally in the following way:
Two vertices $a$ and $b$ have an odd vel between them if there exists a vertex $c$ such that there are oddly trimmed paths from $a$ to $c$ and from $b$ to $c$, one of even length (possibly 0) and one of odd length.
Notice that an oddly trimmed path of odd length is just an instance of an odd vel where the even path is of length 0.

The formal proof why all NAND-clauses from vertices connected by vels are provable in Neg can be found in Section~\ref{sec:Provability of NAND-clauses from vels}.

There are obviously other ways of altering directions of individual edges in a path.
The next example will however show that most of them will alter the OR-clauses in such a way that our implication no longer hold.

The figure above shows two odd paths that have had some of their edges flipped.
In both examples, the shown kernels contain both $a$ and $b$, showing that these constructions are not providing a provable NAND-clause $\ol{ab}$ in Neg.
