\section{Proving inconsistency in graph theories}
\label{sec:Proving inconsistency in graph theories}
We have just shown that in the case of unrestricted theories, we have no guarantee that an inconsistency proof can be constructed using unary and binary NAND-clauses only, so whhat about graph theories?
After all, it is these theories that motivated the search for this property in the first place.
Unfortunately, it turns out that even for these kinds of theories, there are inconsistency proofs that requires some non-binary NAND-clauses.
