\begin{lemma}
  Given the graph from Figure ... let the vertices $u$ and $v$ be from different components.
  If $\ol{uv}$ is binary-derivable, then its proof contains either $\ol{a^N}$, $\ol{a^W}$ or $\ol{a^E}$.
  \label{thm:uv_proof_contains_a}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Base Case:
  No axiom $\ol{uv}$ exists such that $u$ and $v$ are vertices from different components, so our claim vacuously holds.

  Induction Step:
  Suppose we have a binary proof of $\ol{uv}$ where $u$ and $v$ are from different components.
  The immediate premise must contain at least one binary NAND-clause containing $u$ and one containing $v$.
  \begin{figure}[!h]

      \Hypo{\ol{u\dots}}
      \Hypo{\ol{v\dots}}
      \Hypo{\dots}
      \Infer[]3{\ol{uv}}
    \end{prooftree*}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:proof_scheme_uv}
  \end{figure}
  If either $u$ or $v$ are in a clause together with a vertex from a component different from their own, we get from the induction hypothesis that their proof must contain either $a^N$, $a^W$ or $a^E$, so we are done.

  Otherwise, $u$ and $v$ are each either in a clause together with the vertex $s$ or a vertex from their own component.
  Both of these cases results in using the OR-clause $sa^Na^Wa^E$ in the last proof step, since it is the only OR-clause containing $s$ and the only OR-clause containing vertices from different components.
  The premise therefore contains two additional NAND-clauses; one of them containing the $a$-vertex of the component not containing $u$ or $v$ - lets call it $a^w$.

  If the clause containing $a^w$ is unary, we are done.
  If the clause containing $a^w$ is binary, it must either contain $u$ or $v$ in order to give $\ol{uv}$ in the conclusion.
  Since $a^w$ is in a component different from both $u$ and $v$, the induction hypothesis gives us the claim.

  The proof must therefore contain either $a^N$, $a^W$ or $a^E$.
\end{proof}
