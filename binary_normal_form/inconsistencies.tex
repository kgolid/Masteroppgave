\section{Inconsistencies in graph theories}
\label{sec:Inconsistencies in graph theories}
In this section, we will prove the existence of non-binary-derivable inconsistencies from graphs.
We will first prove a lemma, then apply this lemma to an extended version of the graph from Figure~\ref{fig:double_open_door} to show that its inconsistency is not binary-derivable.
