In this chapter we will investigate the statement that whenever a theory is inconsistent, it can be proven in Neg using unary and binary NAND-clauses only.
Such a result would be significant both because it would be a strong property for a proof system to have in general, but also because it could potentially help us to further characterize a kernel-free graph.

Having that any inconsistency can be proven in Neg using unary and binary NAND-clauses only, might imply a similar property in kernel-free graphs, namely that inconsistencies can be described as a collection of pairwise structural relations between vertices.

We will check the statement first for non-graph-based theories and then for theories based on graphs with different properties.
