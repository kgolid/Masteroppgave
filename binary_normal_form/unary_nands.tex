\section{Unary NAND-clauses in graph theories}
\label{sec:Unary NAND-clauses in graph theories}
We will to use the fact that some binary NAND-clauses are not binary-derivable to show that some \textit{unary} NAND-clauses are not binary-derivable.

We use our graph from Figure~\ref{fig:open_door} to make the following, bigger graph:\par
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    [
    point/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm}

\FloatBarrier
The above graph contains two copies of the graph from Figure~\ref{fig:open_door}, only connected by their shared vertex $a$ and the vertex $t$ that has both $b^L$ and $b^R$ in its neighborhood.
We will refer to the two copies as the left component and the right component, with $a$ being in both and $t$ being in none.

The rest of this section will show that the unary NAND-clause $\ol{a}$ is provable, but not binary derivable.
