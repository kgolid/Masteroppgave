Any propositional discourse can be represented as a propositional theory in a specific form in such a way that the theory is inconsistent if and only if the discourse is paradoxical.
Propositional theories in this form can be represented as directed graphs such that the models of the theory correspond to the kernels of the digraph.
This thesis looks at a sound, refutationally complete, non-explosive resolution system over such propositional theories.
We investigate the relation between various graph structures and clauses provable by the resolution system from the corresponding theory.
We also show that a restricted version of the resolution system is \textit{not} refutationally complete.
