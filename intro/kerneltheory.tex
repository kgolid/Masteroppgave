\section{Results in Kernel Theory}
\label{sec:Results in Kernel Theory}
The end goal within Kernel Theory is ultimately to develop an easy way of answering the question ``Does this digraph have a kernel?'' no matter the graph, and no matter the answer.
As of today, we are not quite there, but a lot of work has been put into trying to identify special circumstances under which one is guaranteed to have (or guaranteed to not have) a kernel in the given graph.
One of the results is the theorem proven by Moses Richardson in 1953:
\begin{theorem}[\cite{am-richardson}]
  If D is a finitary digraph without odd cycles, then D has a kernel.
\end{theorem}
Intuitively, one might be tempted to believe that \textit{all} digraphs without odd cycles have kernels, but this is not the case.
Until now, all our paradoxes have been statements that -- directly or indirectly -- have been referring back to themselves (giving cycles in the graph) and thus causing a logical conflict, and it is hard to imagine any other way to construct paradoxical statements.
The following construction will however reveal our lack of imagination.

The \textit{Yablo Graph}\cite{analysis-yablo} is an example of an acyclic graph with no kernel.
It is constructed with an infinite set of vertices $\{ x_i \;|\; i \in \mathbb{N} \}$ and a set of edges $N$ such that $\langle x_i, x_j \rangle \in N$ iff $i < j$.

  \label{fig:yablo-graph}
\end{figure}

Since there exist no two numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x < y$ and $y < x$, we get that the Yablo graph indeed is acyclic.
Furthermore, since any natural number has infinitely many numbers strictly larger than it, we get that all the vertices are infinitely branching, making the Yablo graph infinitary.

The discourse represented by the Yablo graph would -- informally -- be the situation with an infinite number of statements, all saying ``Every statement after this statement is false''.

We will later show formally that the Yablo-graph is indeed without a kernel, but for now the following explanation should suffice.

Suppose that the Yablo-graph \textit{has} a kernel and that the vertex $x_a$ is in it.
Then all the vertices to the right of $x_a$ are necessarily outside of the kernel, including $x_{a+1}$.
But if $x_{a+1}$ is outside of the kernel, it has to point to a vertex on the inside.
This is now impossible, since the out-neighborhood of $x_{a+1}$ is a subset of the out-neighborhood of $x_a$.
Since $x_a$ was chosen without any restrictions, no vertex can be inside the kernel, making it empty.
Since no kernel can be empty, we have a contradiction, making the Yablo-graph without a kernel.

One thing should be mentioned at this point, the inverse of Richardson's statement is not valid; neither odd cycles nor infinitely branching vertices \textit{entail} that their respective graphs are paradoxical.
The following two graphs illustrate this point:
\[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      [
      point/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm},
      collection/.style={thick,rectangle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum height=14mm, minimum width= 9mm}
      ]
      \node (0) at (0,1) [point,label=above:$x_0$] {};
      \node (1) at (0,0) [point,label=below:$x_1$] {};
      \node (2) at (1,0) [point,label=below:$x_2$] {};
      \draw [-latex] (0) to (1);
      \draw [-latex] (1) to (2);
      \draw [-latex, bend left] (2) to (0);
      \draw [-latex, bend left] (0) to (2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\]
The above graph contains an odd cycle, but the singleton set $\{x_2\}$ is a kernel.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    [
    point/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm},
    collection/.style={thick,rectangle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum height=14mm, minimum width= 9mm}
    ]
    \node (0) at (1,2) [point,label=above:$x_0$] {};
    \node (1) at (0,1) [point,label=below:$x_1$] {};
    \node (2) at (1,1) [point,label=below:$x_2$] {};
    \node (3) at (2,1) [point,label=below:$x_3$] {};
    \node (4) at (3,1) [] {$\dots$};
    \draw [-latex] (0) to (1);
    \draw [-latex] (0) to (2);
    \draw [-latex] (0) to (3);
    \draw [dashed] (0) to (4);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{}
  \label{infinitary_with_kernel}
\end{figure}

The above graph has an infinitely branching vertex $x_0$, but the infinite set $\{x_i \;|\; x > 0\}$ is a kernel.

It is shown in \cite{cook} that every digraph (with at least one edge) can be transformed into a infinitary dag such that the assignment $\alpha$ is a solution to the created dag if and only if it is a solution to the original digraph.
This means that for any finitary graph that is paradoxical by the virtue of having an odd cycle, there is an infinitary, \textit{acyclic} digraph that is also paradoxical.
So if one is trying to find ways to identify paradoxical graphs, one does only need to look at dags.

This result will be of great importance to us, enabling us to narrow our search space when looking for paradoxes.
