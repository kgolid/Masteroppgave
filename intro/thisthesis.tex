\section{This thesis}
\label{sec:This thesis}
The soundness and refutational completeness of Neg makes it a potentially great tool in the overarching endeavor of weakening the conditions for kernels in graphs.
We know that for any graph $G$, $\varnothing$ can be proven in Neg based on $G$ if and only if $G$ is without a kernel.

With that in mind, this thesis will set out to do two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define a graph structural relation such that two vertices $a,b$ in a graph $G$ are related if and only if $G \vdash \ol{ab}$.
  \item Explore whether Neg is still refutationally complete when restricted to only using NAND-clauses of length 1 or 2.
\end{enumerate}
Suppose that any inconsistency can be proven using only NAND-clauses of length at most 2, and that all NAND-clauses of length 2 corresponds to vertices related in a certain way in the graph.
This would in combination give us a condition for kernels, namely the absence of such specifically related vertices.

It will however become apparent that such a relation must be rather complex.
In addition, it turns out that Neg is \textit{not} refutationally complete under the restrictions mentioned.
\label{sub:Thesis Overview}
In Chapter 2, we will be looking at increasingly general graph structures that ensures the provability of certain NAND-clauses, ultimately attempting to reach a structure general enough so that the provability of a NAND-clause entails the existence of that structure.

Chapter 3 will present graphs where certain NAND-clauses are provable in general, but not under the restrictions mentioned.
This will be used to show that the restrictions makes Neg unable to prove inconsistencies in certain graphs.
