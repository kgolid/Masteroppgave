\label{sec:Thesis overview}
The soundness and refutational completeness of Neg makes it a potentially great tool in the overarching endeavor of weakening the conditions for kernels in graphs.
We know that for any graph $G$, $\varnothing$ can be proven in Neg based on $G$ if and only if $G$ is without a kernel.

Suppose that any inconsistency can be proven using only NAND-clauses of length at most 2, and that all NAND-clauses of length 2 correspond to vertices related in a certain way in the graph.
This would in combination give us a condition for kernels, namely the absence of such specifically related vertices.
With this in mind, the thesis will set out to do two things:

(1) Define a graph structural relation such that two vertices $a,b$ in a graph $G$ are so related if and only if $G \vdash \ol{ab}$.

This will be covered in Chapter 2 where we will be looking at increasingly general graph structures that ensure the provability of certain NAND-clauses, ultimately attempting to reach a structure general enough so that the provability of a NAND-clause entails the existence of that structure.

(2) Explore whether Neg is still refutationally complete when restricted to using NAND-clauses of length 1 or 2 only.

It will be shown in Chapter 3 that this is \textit{not} possible.
The chapter will present graphs where certain NAND-clauses are provable in general, but not under the restrictions mentioned.
This will then be used to show that Neg, when under the restrictions of only using NAND-clauses of length 1 or 2, is unable to prove inconsistencies in certain graphs.
