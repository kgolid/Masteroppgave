This thesis has found various graph structures implying provability of certain NAND-clauses in Neg.
The process of continuously generalizing these structures has given several examples of unconventional graphs still providing provable clauses.
One of these exemplified that some provable binary NAND-clauses are not binary-derivable.
This example was further extended to show that the inference system is \textit{not} refutationally complete when restricted to using binary NAND-clauses only.

If one where to continue on this work, several aspects of Neg are still left untouched.
One example is its non-explosiveness.
Neg is not complete, so it does \textit{not} hold in general that $G \vDash \ol{A} \Rightarrow G \vdash \ol{A}$.
It seems like Neg can prove a NAND-clause $\ol{A}$ when none of its subsets $\ol{B} \subset \ol{A}$ are provable.
This can be formalized as the following conjecture:
\begin{conjecture}
  Given a graph $G$ and a set of vertices $A \subseteq G$:
  \begin{align}
    G \vDash \ol{A} \wedge \forall B \subset A: G \not\vDash \ol{ B } \;\Rightarrow \; \vdash A
  \end{align}
\end{conjecture}

Also, more work could be put into exploring graph structural relations $V$ such that $G \vdash \ol{ab} \Rightarrow V(a,b)$.
In hindsight, such a relation could potentially contribute to Walicki's conjecture in a more direct way than what relations satisfying the inverse implication would.
