\subsubsection{Translating CNF to GNF}
\label{subs:Translating CNF to GNF}
Since any PL theory can be expressed in CNF, showing that any theory $P$ in CNF can be translated to a theory $R$ in GNF such that $P$ and $R$ are equisatisfiable gives us that any PL theory has an equisatisfiable GNF.

Given any CNF theory $P$, start with an empty theory $R$ and for each formula in $P$, follow the steps below to acquire its corresponding GNF formulae.

\textbf{Step 1:}
For each literal $\neg x_i$ in the formula, introduce a fresh variable $x'_i$ and add the following two GNF formulae to $R$: $x'_i \lar \neg x_i, x_i \lar \neg x'_i,$ (unless this has already been done while translating an earlier formula in the theory).

\textbf{Step 2:}
In each clause, replace every negative literal $\neg x_i$ with its corresponding $x'_i$ fom step 1. Every clause does now contain all positive literals.
For every clause $(x_1 \vee x_2 \vee \dots \vee x_n)$, create a fresh variable $y$ and add the following GNF formula to $R$:
\[y \lar (\neg x_1 \wedge \neg x_2 \wedge \dots \wedge \neg x_n \wedge \neg y)\]
The combined set of all these acquired formulae will make up the the corresponding theory $R$.
We have only added proper GNF formulae and all variables appear to the left in exactly one clause, so $R$ will indeed be a GNF theory.\\

\begin{example}
  \begin{align}
    \text{CNF:\quad}& ( a \vee b )\\
    \text{GNF:\quad}& ( a \lar \neg a'), (a' \lar \neg a), (b \lar \neg b'), (b' \lar \neg b), (y_1 \lar (\neg a \wedge \neg b \wedge \neg y_1))\\
    \\
    \text{CNF:\quad}& (\neg a)\\
    \text{GNF:\quad}& ( a \lar \neg a'), (a' \lar \neg a), (y_1 \lar (\neg a' \wedge \neg y_1))\\
  \end{align}
\end{example}
