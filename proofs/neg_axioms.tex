\section{Axioms in Neg proofs}
\label{sec:Axioms in Neg proofs}
\begin{definition}
  A Neg proof is \textit{thin} if each rule application in the proof contains an axiomatic NAND-clause in its premise.
\end{definition}
In this section, we will prove the following statement:
\begin{theorem}
  Any NAND-clause provable in Neg has a thin proof.
\end{theorem}
Equivalently, for any Neg-proof $P$ there exists a thin Neg-proof with the same conclusion.
We will prove this theorem by inducing over the height of $P$.
